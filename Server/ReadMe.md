ðŸ”’ Secure Data Processing Server

A standalone agent â†’ server pipeline built in pure Java (no frameworks, no external MQs).
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a modular, maintainable, and scalable data ingestion system.

ðŸš€ Architecture

Flow:

Components :

1) Secure Socket Server: Accepts agent connections and reads data.

2) Queue (In-Memory): Buffers incoming payloads for decoupling.

3) Data Manipulation Layer: Decrypts payloads with JCA and validates.

4) Router: Determines target server (File, Image, Log).

5) Servers:

      FileServer â€“ handles file payloads.

      ImageServer â€“ handles image payloads.

      LogServer â€“ handles log payloads.
